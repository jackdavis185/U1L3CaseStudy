## A Case Study about Kiva Microlending

By John Davis, Lauren Krohn, and Jake Hain

### How Kiva is Helping Millions of Entrepreneurs

Kiva is a non-profit organization that extends microloans to impoverished borrowers. Their biggest competitor is Grameen Bank.  Kiva funds their microlending activity through crowdfunding.

Kiva uses PayPal to set up payments directly to borrowers.  Kiva is able to save on administration costs through this direct lending strategy.  As a result, Kiva's impverished borrowers pay no interest or fees.

### What Makes Kiva Unique?

Unlike other microlending companies, Kiva is leveraging FinTech to crowdsource funds and to connect borrowers directly with individual lenders. This results in Direct low-interest or even interest-free loans, rather than working through a local partner system in which borrowers pay higher-than-average rates.
