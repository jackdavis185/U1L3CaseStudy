## A Case Study about Kiva Microlending

By John Davis, Lauren Krohn, and Jake Hain

### How Kiva is Helping Millions of Entrepreneurs

Kiva is a non-profit organization that extends microloans to impoverished borrowers. Their biggest competitor is Grameen Bank.  Kiva funds their microlending activity through crowdfunding.

Kiva uses PayPal to set up payments directly to borrowers.  Kiva is able to save on administration costs through this direct lending strategy.  As a result, Kiva's impverished borrowers pay no interest or fees.
